# Implementation of BFS and DFS plus some more in java

This was made as a project in my algorithms and data structures class and demonstrates some implementations ive done. The ProblemSolver
class was written entirely by me and implements the IProblemsolver interface. Ive not included all the dependencies needed to run the code as this is just
a demonstration.
